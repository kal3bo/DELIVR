A delivery company uses drones to deliver small shipments from its business building to their customers. DELIVR is a training VR system for new staff. To better understand the customer experience, the drone operators must switch roles with the end-customers to experience the package delivery and improve it. Safety protocol practices are essential to this project. The drone operators must review and save their scores at the end of the experience. 

A manager will review the scores of the staff after completing the VR training course and will decide if the trainee is capable of operating the drones to real deliveries.
